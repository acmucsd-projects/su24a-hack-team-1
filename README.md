# ProjectUp 

## 01 Background/inspiration:
- Our idea - We were inspired by combining the idea of productivity with the functionality of dating apps
    - What if there was a way to look through nearby projects/activities and express your interest in them?
    - What if a community of students can unite with other students to help facilitate tasks easier in one app?
- Our product - A dating app but for projects/activities rather than dates
    - Restricted to school areas so individuals are serious about the events
    - Post about your activity and let students show their interest through a âœ… or âž–
- Roles:
  - Shamita - `Frontend Develepor` 
  - Carl - `Frontend Develepor` 
  - Jared - `Frontend Develepor` 
  - Osheen - `Backend Develepor` 
  - Jason - `Backend Develepor` 


## 02 **Features we implemented + wanted to implemented**

- Create a profile â†’ implemented
- Messaging (stretch goal) â†’ could not implement
- Posting Algorithm â†’ implemented
- Keeping track of likes/dislikes on posts â†’ could not implement
- Resume upload feature â†’ implemented
- View other posts â†’ implemented

## 04 **Technical Process**

- Learning phase -> watching tutorials and online research to get a hang of the tech stack + code syntax
- Notes -> compiling coding notes + sharing in meeting
- Features -> each person working on a different feature and pushing code to their branch

## 05 Our tech stack 

- Figma
- Vite React
- ExpressJS
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## 06 Challenges

- Time
- Summer schedules
- School
- Unrealistic Goals for First Web Development Project

## 07 Reflection

- Make more realistic goals
- Check in with team more
- Communication is very important
- Make project more simple
- Learn the basics

# ðŸ’» MERN stack template

Template for building projects with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.
This template was generated using `create-next-app` and `express-generator` for the
client and server, respectively.

## Prerequisites

- Install Node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install `yarn` with the command `npm install -g yarn`
- Set up a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcOL5h_ZFJM) for help!
- Create a `.env` file with a variable called `DB_URL` and paste your MongoDB url:

```bash
DB_URL=mongodb://mongodburl.example.com:portnumber
```

## Running

1. `cd` into `client` and run the command `yarn install` to install all dependencies
2. To start the client, run `yarn dev` in the same directory
3. In another command window, `cd` into `server` and run `yarn install` and `npm start`
   to install all dependencies and start the server.
4. To kill a port, use 'npx kill-port <PORT_NUMBER>'
5. For Linux/Mac use 'sudo lsof' to see what ports are active.
6. For Windows, use 'netstat -a -b'
7. If you want to change the port for server, head to the server/bins/www. 
   Look for the line ```var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3001');```
    Change it to any port you like!
8. Happy hacking!
